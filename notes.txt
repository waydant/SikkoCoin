Shortcomings of simple coins

- [ ]  permissioned setting(no. of participants is static)
- [ ]  Block structure
    - [ ]  Difficulty threshold
- [ ]  Validation of blocks is not implemented
- [ ]  Validation of transactions
- [ ]  Make a central authority who maintains pool of transaction\


User encompasses
    individual blockchain
    individual pool of transactions(updates the list from common pool of transactions(counter based))


block
    

txn input
    txn_hash 
    block index
    output index

    using the block index, we go to the block and then from the list of transactions we search the transaction.
    a transaction in a block is whole {transaction,hash}.
    after getting the transaction see the output index. Also verify that the corresponding output index isnt used in further blocks

verify_txn
    signing the hash of input_list, output_list, owner.
